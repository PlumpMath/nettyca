# nettyca

A bit of code for starting up a [Netty](http://netty.io) tcp client or
server, which delegates control for each connection to a
protocol handler function you define. Your protocol function will be
passed a pair of [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async)
channels, which you use in your handler for reading and writing to a
client. This is not for production! Just a way to play with writing
tcp client and servers in terms of core.async channels. It uses Netty
5 and Clojure 1.7 __alpha__ releases.

## Usage

Add `nettyca` as a dependency in your `project.clj` file:

```clj
(defproject example-project "x.y.z"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0-alpha2"]
                 [nettyca "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
                 [ch.qos.logback/logback-classic "1.1.2"]])
```

Notice the Clojure version is alpha, this is required in order to
operate on channels with
[transducers](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming).
Also notice, in the example above, included is a Java logging
implementation. If your project already has one, leave the
[logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) dependency out.

### Quick Start

To start an echo server and client in the repl, follow these steps:

```clj
(use 'nettyca.core)
;; start netty tcp server, passing a fn which accepts two args, r and w chans
(def sys (start "127.0.0.1" 9090 echo-server-timeout :server))
;; try telnet 127.0.0.1 9090 now
;; or run an echo tcp client provided as an example
(start "127.0.0.1" 9090 echo-client-test :client)
(stop sys)
```

See the [core namespace](src/nettyca/core.clj) for other examples of a simple echo protocol.

### Why?

There already exists a robust and feature complete set of libraries which
implement a channel abstraction in conjuction with Netty, it is called
[Aleph](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph). This library, `nettyca` is
tiny and incompletely emulates just one or two specific cases of Aleph's
functionality. Therefore this library is only for someone who might want
to play with the very latest Netty and core.async libraries, without
re-writing the Java interop code to wire them together.

### Server Detail

To start an echo server in the repl, follow these steps:

First load and refer in the `nettyca/core` ns:

    user=> (use 'nettyca.core)
    ... log messages omitted ...

Next define an echo server as a function which accepts two arguments,
the read channel and write channel respectively.

    user=> (defn echo [r w] (clojure.core.async/pipe r w))
    #'user/echo

In this simplest implementation, we just use core.async `pipe`
function to send values from the read channel to the write channel.
You'll notice that we could simply pass the `pipe` function directly
because of the similar arguments expected, but for any protocol less
trivial, you'll be implementing your own function, as shown here.

Next, start a Netty server listening on a port:

    user=> (def sys (start 9090 echo-server-timeout))
    ... log messages omitted ...

Now you can telnet to port 9090:

    $ telnet localhost 9090
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    56
    56
    Connection closed by foreign host.

Finally, stop the server:

    user=> (stop sys)
    ... log messages omitted ...

That's it!

### Client Detail

With the `nettyca/core` ns loaded and referred:

```clj
(start "127.0.0.1" 9090 echo-client-test :client)
```

You'll notice there is no corresponding stop function for client
connections. The handler for clients is passed 3 channels, read, write
and "connection" respectively. Closing the "connection" channel closes
and cleans up resources associated with the connection.

### Example

An example of a program to check existence of mailbox using SMTP can
be found [https://github.com/marsmining/evalid/blob/5d8b2a947b368a2c8003b8eceb42bb5684960ac7/src/evalid/core.clj](here).

### Command Line Interface

See the [cli namespace](src/nettyca/cli.clj) for examples of starting
from the cli versus repl.
